# Mereocausality

I develop a novel concept that I call "mereocausality" (and cognates such as "mereocausation", "mereotopological causality", etc.). I combine the concepts of parthood and causality to posit that of mereocausality, asking questions of causality of parts and their composed whole. 'Mereo' is from the Greek 'μερος' or ‘part’, which is presently pronounced as 'meros'. 'αιτία' is Greek for 'cause'. I also develop the concept of _mereotopocausality_ to further merge that of mereotopology, which in turn is a combination of mereology and topology.

## Scope
Causality, mereology, topology, mereotopology, philosophy of these concepts and theories thereof, formal ontological and conceptual analysis thereof, knowledge representaiton applied to these topics, etc.

## Purpose
- To contribute to the intellectual research and disciplines such as philosophy (generaL), philosophy of causality, mereology, philosophy of science, coneptual analysis, formal ontology, knowledge representation and reasoning, conceptual modeling, etc.
- To explore and theorize about the intersection of causality and mereology (and topology). To posit theories or accounts thereof.
- To potentially identify or posit metaphyiscal, formal ontological, and/or artifiical relations of what I call 'mereocausation'.
- To innovate in concept development & analysis, semantic analysis, formal ontology and philosophy.
- To develop a formal theory, utilizing symbolic logics, of mereocausality

## Status
- In progress, dependent on support
- As a personal project, unfunded to date, support is needed.

## History & Origins
These two concepts and topics of study--causality and mereology--have been a primary interest, intended to be pursued were I to find a PhD study option. 
Causality has been a longstanding intellectual interest since my undergraduate studies (2003-2007), where I formally studied the philosphy of causality/causation. Interest in mereology began upon its discovery in my graduate studies (2009), which was followed by work opportunities involving causal theories and symbolic logic During these activities I began to wonder about and posit categories such as 'causal system', and whether there are causal kinds (another unpubblished paper as of June 2023). I also wondered if causality varied based on parts in relation to their whole. Hence, I coined the term 'mereocausality' to signify the (potential) causality/causation among parts and their whole or among types of parts.
