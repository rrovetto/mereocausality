# Mereocausality

I develop a novel concept that I call "mereocausality" (and cognates such as "mereocausation", "mereotopological causality", etc.).

### Scope
Causality, mereology, topology, mereotopology, philosophy of these concepts and theories, formal ontological analysis thereof, knowledge representaiton applied to these topics, etc.

### Purpose
- To contribute to the intellectual research and disciplines such as philosophy (generaL), philosophy of causality, mereology, philosophy of science, coneptual analysis, formal ontology, knowledge representation and reasoning, conceptual modeling, etc.
- To explore and theorize about the intersection of causality and mereology (and topology). To posit theories or accounts thereof.
- To potentially identify or posit metaphyiscal, formal ontological, and/or artifiical relations of what I call 'mereocausation'.

### Status
- In progress, dependent on support
- As a personal project, support is needed.

## Support - How you can help
You can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, [Contact](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact), or [schedule a meeting](https://tinyurl.com/hm8wu2sa)
