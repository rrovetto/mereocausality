# Mereocausality, Mereocausation and Causal Mereotopology

I develop a novel concept that I call "mereocausality" (and cognates such as "mereocausation", "mereotopological causality", etc.). I combine the concepts of parthood and causality to posit that of mereocausality, asking questions of causality of parts and their composed whole. I combine the words 'causation' or 'causality' and 'mereology' to form the new name 'mereocausality' and 'mereocausation'. 'Mereo' is from the Greek 'μερος' or ‘part’, which is presently pronounced as 'meros'. 'αιτία' is Greek for 'cause'. I also develop the concept of _mereotopocausality_ and _causal mereotopology_ to further merge that of mereotopology, which in turn is a combination of mereology and topology. Causal mereotopology may become a new research topic in disciplines such as: philosophy, formal and applied ontology, knowledge representation and reasoning in AI, coneptual modeling, semantic analysis, etc.

## Scope
Causality, mereology, topology, mereotopology, philosophy of these concepts and theories thereof, formal ontological and conceptual analysis thereof, knowledge representaiton applied to these topics, etc.

## Purpose
- To contribute to intellectual research, and disciplines such as philosophy (general), philosophy of causality, mereology, philosophy of science, coneptual analysis, formal ontology, knowledge representation and reasoning (in artificial intelligence), conceptual modeling, etc.
- To explore and theorize about the intersection of causality and mereology (and topology). To posit theories or accounts thereof.
- To potentially identify or posit metaphyiscal, formal ontological, and/or artifiical relations of what I call 'mereocausation'.
- To innovate in concept development & analysis, semantic analysis, formal ontology and philosophy.
- To develop a formal theory, utilizing symbolic logics, of mereocausality and causal mereotopolgy

## Status
- In progress.
- As a personal project, unfunded to date (since approx. 2014), support is needed.

## Support - How you can help
You can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposals, mentorship, etc. [Contact](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact), or [schedule a meeting](https://tinyurl.com/hm8wu2sa)

## History & Origins
Causality and mereology have been a primary interest of mine since my university studies (approx. 2003-2011), intended to be pursued were I to find a PhD study option. 
Causality, in particular, has been a longstanding intellectual interest since my undergraduate studies (2003-2007), where I formally studied the philosphy of causality/causation. Interest in mereology began upon its discovery in my graduate studies (2009), which was followed by a research opportunity wherein I further researched causal theories and symbolic logic. In these time periods I began to wonder about (and posit) categories such as 'causal system', and whether there are causal kinds (another unpublished paper as of August 2023). I also wondered if causality varied based on parts in relation to their whole. Hence, I coined the term 'mereocausality' to signify the (potential) causality/causation among parts and their whole or among types of parts.
